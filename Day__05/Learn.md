    ## some Notes ###
    Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: <script type="text/javascript">.
    The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.

    ###
    placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element inprove the display speed,because script interation slows down the display
    
    ### 
    Using external JS is the best practice, seperates js and markup code , easied to read , write and maintain code and cached js files can improve page load speed.HTML

    ### in the JS always use cameCase FormData


    ###
    Js can write using innerHTML to changes content. 
    Using write() can changes the html dom. but using after loading page write can remove whole markup .( only use for testing purpose)
    
    ###
    window.alert(); for something show  as alert in the windows. you can scip window as window is global scope object .
    variables, properties and methods by default belong to window object .

    ###
    print();
    

    ###
    console.log()
    for debugging and use almost whole life :D
